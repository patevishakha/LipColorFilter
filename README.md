# LipColorFilter
This is the project implemented in openCV and DLib .In this project i have detected the face and pointed landmarks on the face.I have seperated the lips from complete face and then merged original image with colored lips .using trackbars lip color filter can be applied on the image.

shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat -->  file can be accessed using dlib library this is the trained file which predicts 68 landmarks.
LandmarkPointImage.jpg  --> This Image indicates how facial lanmarks are detected.
